# Content Recommendations
Website to remember all those great recommendations from friends on streaming content sites.

# Description
Hm, what was that show your friend recommended to you on Netflix again? With so many shows available on content streaming sites it’s hard to remember all those good recommendations!
This website lets you store the TV shows and movies your friends recommended to you — so you can watch them later. Write descriptions your friends gave you so you can remember why you wanted to watch the show!

# How to View the Site
1) Install Vagrant and VirtualBox 
2) Clone the fullstack-nanodegree-vm repository. 
3) Launch the Vagrant VM (run vagrant up).
4) Set up the database and add some data by running database_setup.py
then run seed_data.py.
5) Run the application within the VM by typing python flask_webserver.py into
the Terminal. 
6) Access the application by visiting http://localhost:8000 locally in your
browser.
